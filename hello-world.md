# Hello world!

Hi there!  

It seems you've found your way to my first article.  
Recently I have been thinking about writing articles for my website.  
You could call it a tech blog, but that would sort of suggest that I write on a regular basis about the tech industry.  
Maybe you could call it a "captain's log" for a software engineer, but that just sounds crazy, right?  
I've decided to keep it simple and call it "Articles".  
  
Here I will be writing about all the cool stuff I learn as a software developer.  
Since I wrote my first line of code, I have been in love with creating software.  
And I have been learning about it ever since...  

My first bit of code was a simple PHP website for a highschool project. Simple, but fun.  
Now, being a software professional, I still really enjoy building software.  
Way more complex, ofcourse, but as fun as the first day.  
In my free time, I still do some hobby coding on way too many pet projects.  
Being able to work on a variety of cool projects, gives me the opportunity to learn a lot.

There's so many things I've learned, that I already forgot some of those.  
And that's a shame, you'll surely agree.  
Here is my way to document my learnings.  
Practical for me, (hopefully) useful for you and probably good laughing material in a few years.  

I will be writing these articles on GitHub on a feel-like-it basis and they will be displayed on my website!

_Great stuff, but I thought this was about tech?_  
Yes, so I'll tell you about the feature I built into my (customly built) website to display my articles.  

## Articles feature
How I built a Markdown display tool with PHP on my website.  

### A little introduction
When I studied computer science, I had a student job as a PHP developer.  
We built all kinds of websites for small to medium size companies in the area.  
I decided to build myself a website, since that would look cool on my CV.  
So I did, in PHP, ofcourse.  

My project has started in 2015 and is built on the Symfony framework.  
Ever since, I have been upgrading and it is currently one of the latest versions.  
Professionally, I do not work on PHP projects anymore, but I still enjoy writing PHP.  
The newest upgrade will be the Articles feature.  

### First thoughts
Since Markdown became a thing in open source software projects, I've found it easy to use.  
For that reason I thought it would be a good idea to write my articles that way.  
Considering my articles were going to be published anyway, I might as well store them on GitHub.  
They have a brilliant Markdown editor that I can use to my advantage.  

I also considered building an editor into my existing website.  
But why re-invent the wheel? GitHub's solution is great and well usable.  
It did give me some new questions about how my website would display them, however.  

For example:
- How to convert Markdown to HTML for displaying?
- Will my articles be updated when I changed them or write a new one?
- Can I choose which articles to "feature" on my home page?
- Is this possible without complicated authentication systems?

I did a little research and came up with this idea:
